## What is Vue.js

Vue.js is a JavaScript framework that makes building interactive and reactive web frontend code easier.

**Reactive websites** - When a website is responsive to what the user does (clicks, hovers, writing, etc). On desktop or web applications this happens almost instantly because the User Interface is install on the device, but on web applications the first approach is that every time the user clicks on something it would render another page. This creates another http request, waits for it and then shows the data; this means more time and resources.
